We will be using two electrodes: Fp1 (one inch above left eye) and Fp2 
(one inch above right eye).

We will be extracting two frequency bands from each electrode: alpha (8 
- 12 Hz) and beta (12 - 30 Hz).

Alpha waves are associated with relaxation and beta waves are associated 
with excitation.

These frequency bands are free of noise from muscles, eyes, electronics, 
heart, &c.

We will be measuring two emotion characteristics: valence (pleasant - 
unpleasant) and arousal (excitation - inhibition).

Left frontal inactivation -> negative valence.
Right frontal inactivation -> positive valence.

We will use the following formulas: valence = (a_Fp2/b_Fp2) - (a_Fp1/b_Fp1), where a_Fp2 means the alpha band power from electrode Fp2. [Ramirez 2012]

Note: In [Bhaveek 2018], the formula for valence has the division flipped. E.g. b/a instead of a/b as in [Ramirez 2012].

arousal = (b_Fp1 + b_Fp2)/(a_Fp1 + a_Fp2), [Bhaveek 2018]
